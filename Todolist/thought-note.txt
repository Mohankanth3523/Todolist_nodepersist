
Todolist with Node-persist storage
 

Front-end:
The React.js front-end efficiently manages the user interface and state through components.
The key components include App.js, responsible for rendering the task list and handling user input.

Back-end:
The Node.js/Express.js back-end handles HTTP requests and interacts with the Node-persist storage.
It provides two key endpoints: GET /api/tasks for fetching tasks and POST /api/tasks for adding new tasks.


API Communication:
Axios is used in the front-end to make asynchronous API requests to the back-end.

Clear Task:
Click the button and refresh the page it will delete the task.
